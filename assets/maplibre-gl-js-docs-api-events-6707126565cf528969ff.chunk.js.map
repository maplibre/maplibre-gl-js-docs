Some notes:\n    - Text in double-dollar-strings is _always_ interpreted as some programming code. Text\n      in ordinary quotes is _never_ interpreted that way and highlighted just as a string.\n    - There are quite a bit \"special cases\". That's because many keywords are not strictly\n      they are keywords in some contexts and ordinary identifiers in others. Only some\n      of such cases are handled; you still can get some of your identifiers highlighted\n      wrong way.\n    - Function names deliberately are not highlighted. There is no way to tell function\n      call from other constructs, hence we can't highlight _all_ function names. And\n      some names highlighted while others not looks ugly.\n*/\n\nfunction pgsql(hljs) {\n  const COMMENT_MODE = hljs.COMMENT('--', '$');\n  const UNQUOTED_IDENT = '[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9$]*';\n

For most\n    grammars most of the time we will never actually need anything more than the\n    first MultiRegex - so this shouldn't have too much overhead.\n\n    Say this is our search group, and we match regex3, but wish to ignore it.\n\n      regex1 | regex2 | regex3 | regex4 | regex5    ' ie, startAt = 0\n\n    What we need is a new MultiRegex that only includes the remaining\n    possibilities:\n\n      regex4 | regex5                               ' ie, startAt = 3\n\n    This class wraps all that complexity up in a simple API... `startAt` decides\n    where in the array of expressions to start doing the matching. It\n    auto-increments, so if a match is found at position 2, then startAt will be\n    set to 3.  If the end is reached startAt will return to 0.\n\n    MOST of the time the parser will be setting startAt manually to 0.\n  */\n  class ResumableMultiRegex {\n    constructor() {\n      // @ts-ignore\n      this.rules = [];\n      // @ts-ignore\n      this.multiRegexes = [];\n      this.count = 0;\n\n      this.lastIndex = 0;\n      this.regexIndex = 0;\n    }\n\n    // @ts-ignore\n    getMatcher(index) {\n      if (this.multiRegexes[index]) return this.multiRegexes[index];\n\n      const matcher = new MultiRegex();\n      this.rules.slice(index).forEach(([re, opts]) => matcher.addRule(re, opts));\n      matcher.compile();\n      this.multiRegexes[index] = matcher;\n      return matcher;\n    }\n\n    resumingScanAtSamePosition() {\n      return this.regexIndex !== 0;\n    }\n\n    considerAll() {\n      this.regexIndex = 0;\n    }\n\n    // @ts-ignore\n    addRule(re, opts) {\n      this.rules.push([re, opts]);\n      if (opts.type === \"begin\") this.count++;\n    }\n\n    /** @param {string} s */\n    exec(s) {\n      const m = this.getMatcher(this.regexIndex);\n      m.lastIndex = this.lastIndex;\n      let result = m.exec(s);\n\n      // The following is because we have no easy way to say \"resume scanning at the\n      // existing position but also skip the current rule ONLY\".
