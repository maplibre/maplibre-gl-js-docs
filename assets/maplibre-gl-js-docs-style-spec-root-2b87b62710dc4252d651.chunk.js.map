y0 = a(base^x1 - base^x0)`\n * => `a = (y1 - y0)/(base^x1 - base^x0)`\n *\n * Desired value: `f(x) = y = a * base^x + b`\n * => `f(x) = y0 + a * (base^x - base^x0)`\n *\n * From the above, we can replace the `a` in `a * (base^x - base^x0)` and do a\n * little algebra:\n * ```\n * a * (base^x - base^x0) = (y1 - y0)/(base^x1 - base^x0) * (base^x - base^x0)\n *                     = (y1 - y0) * (base^x - base^x0) / (base^x1 - base^x0)\n * ```\n *\n * If we let `(base^x - base^x0) / (base^x1 base^x0)`, then we have\n * `f(x) = y0 + (y1 - y0) * ratio`.  In other words, `ratio` may be treated as\n * an interpolation factor between the two stops' output values.\n *\n * (Note: a slightly different form for `ratio`,\n * `(base^(x-x0) - 1) / (base^(x1-x0) - 1) `, is equivalent, but requires fewer\n * expensive `Math.pow()` operations.)\n *\n * @private\n*/\nfunction exponentialInterpolation(input, base, lowerValue, upperValue) {\n    const difference = upperValue - lowerValue;\n    const progress = input - lowerValue;\n    if (difference === 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n    else if (base === 1) {\n        return progress / difference;\n    }\n    else {\n        return (Math.pow(base, progress) - 1) / (Math.pow(base, difference) - 1);\n    }\n}\nexport default Interpolate;\n//# sourceMappingURL=interpolate.js.map","import assert from 'assert';\nimport { checkSubtype, ValueType } from '../types';\nimport ResolvedImage from '../types/resolved_image';\nclass Coalesce {\n    constructor(type, args) {\n        this.type = type;\n        this.args = args;\n    }\n    static parse(args, context) {\n        if (args.length < 2) {\n            return context.error('Expectected at least one argument.');\n        }\n        let outputType = null;\n        const expectedType = context.expectedType;\n        if (expectedType && expectedType.kind !== 'value') {\n            outputType = expectedType;\n        }\n        const parsedArgs = [];\n        for (const arg of args.slice(1)) {\n            const parsed = context.parse(arg, 1 + parsedArgs.length, outputType, undefined, { typeAnnotation: 'omit' });\n            if (!parsed)\n                return null;\n            outputType = outputType || parsed.type;\n            parsedArgs.push(parsed);\n        }\n        assert(outputType);\n        // Above, we parse arguments without inferred type annotation so that\n        // they don't produce a runtime error for `null` input, which would\n        // preempt the desired null-coalescing behavior.\n        // Thus, if any of our arguments would have needed an annotation, we\n        // need to wrap the enclosing coalesce expression with it instead.\n        const needsAnnotation = expectedType &&\n            parsedArgs.some(arg => checkSubtype(expectedType, arg.type));\n        return needsAnnotation ?\n            new Coalesce(ValueType, parsedArgs) :\n            new Coalesce(outputType, parsedArgs);\n    }\n    evaluate(ctx) {\n        let result = null;\n        let argCount = 0;\n        let requestedImageName;\n        for (const arg of this.args) {\n            argCount++;\n            result = arg.evaluate(ctx);\n            // we need to keep track of the first requested image in a coalesce statement\n            // if coalesce can't find a valid image, we return the first image name so styleimagemissing can fire\n            if (result && result instanceof ResolvedImage && !result.available) {\n                if (!requestedImageName) {\n                    requestedImageName = result.name;\n                }\n                result = null;\n                if (argCount === this.args.length) {\n                    result = requestedImageName;\n                }\n            }\n            if (result !== null)\n                break;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n    eachChild(fn) {\n        this.args.forEach(fn);\n    }\n    outputDefined() {\n        return this.args.every(arg => arg.outputDefined());\n    }\n    serialize() {\n        const serialized = ['coalesce'];\n        this.eachChild(child => { serialized.push(child.serialize());
