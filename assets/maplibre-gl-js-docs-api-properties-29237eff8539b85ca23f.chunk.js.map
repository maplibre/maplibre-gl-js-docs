Some notes:\n    - Text in double-dollar-strings is _always_ interpreted as some programming code. Text\n      in ordinary quotes is _never_ interpreted that way and highlighted just as a string.\n    - There are quite a bit \"special cases\". That's because many keywords are not strictly\n      they are keywords in some contexts and ordinary identifiers in others. Only some\n      of such cases are handled; you still can get some of your identifiers highlighted\n      wrong way.\n    - Function names deliberately are not highlighted. There is no way to tell function\n      call from other constructs, hence we can't highlight _all_ function names. And\n      some names highlighted while others not looks ugly.\n*/\n\nfunction pgsql(hljs) {\n  const COMMENT_MODE = hljs.COMMENT('--', '$');\n  const UNQUOTED_IDENT = '[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9$]*';\n
