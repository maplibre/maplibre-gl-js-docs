A style's `sprite` property supplies a URL template for loading small images to use in rendering `background-pattern`, `fill-pattern`, `line-pattern`,`fill-extrusion-pattern` and `icon-image` style properties.

```json
"sprite": {{JSON.stringify(
    ref.$root.sprite.example,
    null,
    2
)}}
```

A valid sprite source must supply two types of files:

- An _index file_, which is a JSON document containing a description of each image contained in the sprite. The content of this file must be a JSON object whose keys form identifiers to be used as the values of the above style properties, and whose values are objects describing the dimensions (`width` and `height` properties) and pixel ratio (`pixelRatio`) of the image and its location within the sprite (`x` and{' '} `y`). For example, a sprite containing a single image might have the following index file contents:

```json
{
    "poi": {
        "width": 32,
        "height": 32,
        "x": 0,
        "y": 0,
        "pixelRatio": 1
    }
}
```

- Then the style could refer to this sprite image by creating a symbol layer with the layout property `"icon-image": "poi"`, or with the tokenized value  `"icon-image": "{icon}"` and vector tile features with a `icon` property with the value `poi`.
- _Image files_, which are PNG images containing the sprite data.

Apart from the required `width`, `height`, `x`, and `y` properties, the following optional properties are supported:
<!-- copyeditor ignore retext-passive -->
- `content`: An array of four numbers, with the first two specifying the left, top corner, and the last two specifying the right, bottom corner. If present, and if the icon uses [`icon-text-fit`](/maplibre-gl-js-docs/style-spec/layers/#layout-symbol-icon-text-fit), the symbol's text will be fit inside the content box.
- `stretchX`: An array of two-element arrays, consisting of two numbers that represent the _from_ position and the _to_ position of areas that can be stretched.
- `stretchY`: Same as `stretchX`, but for the vertical dimension.

MapLibre SDKs will use the value of the `sprite` property in the style to generate the URLs for loading both files. First, for both file types, it will append `@2x` to the URL on high-DPI devices. Second, it will append a file extension: `.json` for the index file, and `.png` for the image file. For example, if you specified `"sprite": "https://example.com/sprite"`, renderers would load `https://example.com/sprite.json` and `https://example.com/sprite.png`, or `https://example.com/sprite@2x.json` and `https://example.com/sprite@2x.png`.
