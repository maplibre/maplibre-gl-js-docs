A MapLibre style contains values of various types, most commonly as values for the style properties of a layer.

## Color

The `color` type is a color in the [sRGB color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB). Colors are JSON strings in a variety of permitted formats: HTML-style hex values, RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA. Predefined HTML colors names, like `yellow` and `blue`, are also permitted.

```json
{
    "line-color": "#ff0",
    "line-color": "#ffff00",
    "line-color": "rgb(255, 255, 0)",
    "line-color": "rgba(255, 255, 0, 1)",
    "line-color": "hsl(100, 50%, 50%)",
    "line-color": "hsla(100, 50%, 50%, 1)",
    "line-color": "yellow"
}
```

Especially of note is the support for HSL, which can be [easier to reason about than RGB](http://mothereffinghsl.com/).


## Formatted

The `formatted` type is a string broken into sections annotated with separate formatting options.

```json
{
    "text-field": ["format",
        "foo", { "font-scale": 1.2 },
        "bar", { "font-scale": 0.8 }
    ]
}
```

## ResolvedImage

The `resolvedImage` type is an image (e.g., an icon or pattern) which is used in a layer. An input to the `image` expression operator is checked against the current map style to see if it is available to be rendered or not, and the result is returned in the `resolvedImage` type. This approach allows developers to define a series of images which the map can fall back to if previous images are not found, which cannot be achieved by providing, for example, `icon-image` with a plain string (because multiple strings cannot be supplied to `icon-image` and multiple images cannot be defined in a string).

```json
{
    "icon-image": ["coalesce", ["image", "myImage"], ["image", "fallbackImage"]]
}
```


## String

A string is text. In MapLibre styles, strings are in quotes.

```json
{
    "source": "mySource"
}
```


## Boolean

Boolean means yes or no, so it accepts the values `true` or `false`.

```json
{
    "fill-enabled": true
}
```


## Number

A number value, often an integer or floating point (decimal number). Written without quotes.

```json
{
    "text-size": 24
}
```


## Array

Arrays are comma-separated lists of one or more numbers in a specific order. For example, they're used in line dash arrays, in which the numbers specify intervals of line, break, and line again. If an array is used as an argument in an expression, the array must be wrapped in a `literal` expression.

```json
{
    "line-dasharray": [2, 4]
}

{
    "circle-color": ["in", 1, ["literal", [1, 2, 3]]]
}
```
