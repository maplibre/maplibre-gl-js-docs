This advanced example uses Mapbox GL JS clustering with HTML markers and custom property expressions. To use HTML or SVG for clusters in place of a Mapbox GL layer, you have to manually synchronize the clustered source with a pool of marker objects that updates continuously while the map view changes.

{{ <Example html={html} {...this.props} /> }}
